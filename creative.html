            For teenage Nola (Sabrina Carpenter),
             home is the open road. Her self-reliant father (Steven Ogg)
              is her anchor in a life of transience. The pair crisscross the 
              United States in a lovingly refurbished RV, relishing their 
              independence and making ends meet by doing odd jobs. A shocking 
              rupture, though, casts Nola out on her own. She makes her way to
               Albuquerque, New Mexico, in search of a mother she never knew.
               When her motorhome unexpectedly breaks down, she forges a bond 
               with an auto body shop owner (Danny Trejo),
             and senses the possibility of mooring her ship in this storm.

             I have been in love with sabrinas work since my childhood show
              girl meets world aired and follow her through her journey. 
              This film hits completely different, it's so emotional and 
              gives a rustic and beautiful vibe of life on the road.
               Sabrina brought so much emotion and embraced Nola perfectly.
                The actors are all amazing and all add different characteristics to the movie.
                 It is so touching and the realtionship between Nola and her father
                  is captivating and makes us want to learn more about her and they're life together.
                   We learn the heartbreaking truth behind Nola and her mother.
                    The whole story is so empowering and shows that we can achieve anything that we want!
                     Excellent movie definitely recommend
